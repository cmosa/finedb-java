Jfdb - A Java client for FineDB
======================

A simple Java client for [FineDB](https://raw.github.com/Amaury/FineD), inspired by [Jedis](https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis) client for Redis. 

Current status is very early alpha development, more like a learning playground for me and binary socket communications with Java.
